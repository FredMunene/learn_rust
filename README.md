## Day1
+ What is Cargo and why do you need it?
    * Cargo is a *Rust package manager* It downloads your package's dependencies, compiles your packages, makes distributable packages, and uploads them to [crates.io](https://crates.io/).

+ To install Rust and Cargo on a Linux OS, run below command on the terminal.
`curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh`

For other OS, check this [link] (https://forge.rust-lang.org/infra/other-installation-methods.html) for instructions
